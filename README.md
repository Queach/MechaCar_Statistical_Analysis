# R Analysis

## Overview of Project
An analysis of car data on RScript

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to use RScript to create a statistical analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD variables provided a non-random variance to the mpg values.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, the R-squared value is 0.71 and there is a correlation between the dependant and independant variables

Because the R-squared value is 0.71 the linear model does a good job at predicting mpg of prototypes
